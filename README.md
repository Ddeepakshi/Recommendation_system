🎥 Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System! This is a simple project that provides movie recommendations based on content similarity using cosine similarity. The system analyzes the movie data and suggests movies similar to a selected one.

📚 Overview
The goal of this project is to create a content-based recommendation system that helps users discover movies similar to their preferences. We utilize the Amazon dataset and implement cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between movies based on their features.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Pandas: For data manipulation.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For implementing cosine similarity.

📋 Features
Recommends movies based on their similarity to the selected movie.
Content-based filtering using movie features like title, genre, and description.
Simple and easy-to-understand implementation.
📂 Dataset
The project uses a subset of the Amazon dataset, which contains information about movies, including:

Movie Title 🎬
Genres 📜
Movie Description 📝
⚙️ How It Works

Preprocessing:
Clean the data by removing null values and duplicates.
Combine relevant features (e.g., genres and descriptions) into a single text format for analysis.

Feature Extraction:
Convert the combined text data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF Vectorization.

Cosine Similarity:
Calculate the similarity between movies based on their vector representations.
Use the similarity scores to recommend the top 5 movies similar to the user’s selection.

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/Ddeepakshi/Recommendation-system.git  
cd Recommendation_system

3. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:
bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

 
📈 Results
For a selected movie, the system provides a ranked list of the top 5 similar movies based on their cosine similarity scores.

💡 Future Improvements
Add user interaction through a web interface (e.g., Flask or Streamlit).
Include additional features like user ratings and reviews.
Experiment with hybrid recommendation techniques.
